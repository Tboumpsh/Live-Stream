## About the project:
About the project?
I think almost everything is self-explanatory. You can take a video of yourself and then save it. Do not forget to give the necessary permissions.

## about me :
Hello
I'm Fatemeh.
Fatima Shattouri.
I work with this name in most places. It was Friday and I said to myself, "Let's not take a project?"
So I decided to make a purchase card.
I had seen this project before. It was quite a heart and I hadn't downloaded a plan before.
I would be happy to go to the rest of my ripazitors to get more familiar with me


## Working with the project:

JavaScript is really amazing. It gives you the ability to make something like this.
Just click on the start button and then record a video of yourself and stop it by pressing the stop button. Then you can download or re-record the video. Isn't it great?
